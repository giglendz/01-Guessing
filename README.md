# 01-Guessing
It's time to try and build my first game for C220 with Python!
The purpose of this game was to teach me simple data types and control structures.
This is a guessing game in which the player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 15.  The player is given as many opportunities as they need in order to guess the correct number.
